# add more package
``` 
If you are running Ubuntu, it is strongly suggested to use a package manager like aptitude or synaptic to download and install packages, instead of doing so manually via this website

sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list 
deb http://cz.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu groovy main universe
```
